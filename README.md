Here we can see a well-designed website, divided for the most part by sections and articles, its hierarchy is well distributed since its titles are seen in a larger size. 

In addition to this we can see the images well distributed, since depending on whether we look at the page from a PC, cell phone or tablet, they can be seen either at the top or bottom of the text without interfering with the page.

It is divided into sections which are rectangles to give more dynamism and joy to the page, as well as the animations of both the buttons and the images since if you pass the mouse over it you can see how they change their shape and enlarge. 

All paragraphs and texts are well distributed on the pages since these are the ones that people read first. In addition, at the bottom of the page it has a back to top link designed to make it more different from any other website.
